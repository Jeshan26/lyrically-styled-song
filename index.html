                     I found a love for me<br>
                     Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
                     Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
                     <span class="emphasis">Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me</span>

                  <p class="chorus">
                     Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was<br>
                     I will not give you up this time<br>
                     Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
                     And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                  </p>

                  <p class="move1">
                     Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
                     Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br>
                     When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
                     But you heard it,<br> <span class="emphasis"> "Darling, you look perfect tonight" </span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
                     <span class="highlight">She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home</span><br>
                     I found a love to carry more than just my secrets<br>
                     To carry love, to carry children of our own
                  </p>

                  <p class="chorus">
                     We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds<br>
                     I know we'll be alright this time<br>
                     Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
                     I see my future in your eyes
                  </p>

                  <p class="move1">
                     Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
                     Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br>
                     When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful<br>
                     <span class="emphasis"> I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight</span>
                  </p>

                     Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
                     Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song<br>
                     I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met<br>
                     An angel in person, and she looks perfect<br>
                     <span class="emphasis">Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight</span>
